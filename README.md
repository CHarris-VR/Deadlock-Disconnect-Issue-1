# Deadlock-Disconnect-Issue-1


This project is a personal project aimed at trying to find and solve issues looking at the steam console with intention of helping other users who may be having the specific issues that I am having.

As of 2/7/26, I have been unable to connect and stay connected to games, being disconnected at random intervals and not able to understand why this specific issue is happening. There will be pictures to show examples of codes that I am getting and errors that I am getting as I explain things.
