To whom it may concern:

I have been having issues with a STEAMAUTH issue regarding the authentication of my client for steam with a failure 
While playing deadlock.
Mid match I have been dc'd during game and will now be using console logging to generate files to be able to 

ERROR SPECIFICS:
STEAMAUTH: Client Tacobell Employee received failure code 6

First attempt at trying to parse what was going on didn't seem to go too well. As I didn't catch anything while attempting to run a
bot match and figure out the issue. I was promptly disconnected and everything seem like normal loading between lobbies from
the connection server to the actual lobby. Still the SteamAuth Issue was concerning so I looked further into it and noticed that this was a
common issue for sudden disconnects but wanted to investigate further with the situation.

So takes us to my next error code:

[SteamNetSockets] [#3126470666 SDR server steamid:90281173733143556 vport 0 'server'] closed by peer (2009): NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON

I noticed this code after catching the console
(Yes I was watching it in real time while playing a bot mach)
and caught the message SOS: and decided to follow it.

Which this would mean that my steam account
is having failure to log on due to an issue
being parsed by the server. 
I'll have to continue investigations.

My first theroy given the logs and given my pc set up situation was that a dual logon conflict was happening.
As a gamer, I enjoy changing my name to silly stuff other than my user name such but not limited to:
"Tacobell Emplyoee"
"Shumbin"
"Tiny Bat"
And many more.

I also have a 2 pc setup, one for VR based games and one for pc games and general work flow and coding projects and Analysis.

Come to find out Deadlock can't seem to parse the two instances of having a username for steam logged in multiple places and was creating a mismatch and after
turning off my second pc and relogging into steam on my primary pc, that seemed to fix the issue.

This would be an important thing to note for any streamers who may change their steam name frequently AND use a dual pc streaming set up and may be an issue in other games
however this is the only game where I've personally had this issue. 

My suggestion to anyone having this issue would be to log out of steam off all other devices, set your name on steam, relog and then try playing a full bot match to confrim issues.
