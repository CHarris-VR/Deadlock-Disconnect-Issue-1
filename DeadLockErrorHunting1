To whom it may concern:

I have been having issues with a STEAMAUTH issue regarding the authentication of my client for steam with a failure 
While playing deadlock.
Mid match I have been dc'd during game and will now be using console logging to generate files to be able to 

ERROR SPECIFICS:

First attempt at trying to parse what was going on didn't seem to go too well. As I didn't catch anything while attempting to run a
bot match and figure out the issue. I was promptly disconnected and everything seem like normal loading between lobbies from
the connection server to the actual lobby. Still the SteamAuth Issue was concerning so I looked further into it and noticed
That this was a common issue for sudden disconnects but wanted to investigate further with the situation.

So takes us to my next error code:

[SteamNetSockets] [#3126470666 SDR server steamid:90281173733143556 vport 0 'server'] closed by peer (2009): NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON

I noticed this code after catching the console
(Yes I was watching it in real time while playing a bot mach)
and caught the message SOS: and decided to follow it.

Which this would mean that my steam account
is having failure to log on due to an issue
being parsed by the server. 
I'll have to continue investigations.
